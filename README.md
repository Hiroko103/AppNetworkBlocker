# AppNetworkBlocker

AppNetworkBlocker is a hotkey controlled Windows Forms application to block incoming network packets of the selected process.

The program uses the WinDivert driver to filter packets.

## Notice

The application currently only scans new ports to block every 5 seconds, therefore it is suitable in cases where receiving ports frequently change.
